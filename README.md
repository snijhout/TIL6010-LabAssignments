In this directory, the model for subquestions 1 and 2 can be found alongside the proposal, the midterm and final report. These are all seperate ipynb files and can be found directly under the flytax Project Group 24 folder. The data used for these projects can be found under the Data directory.
For subquestion 3 a seperate directory was made, in which a seperate ipynb file with code can be found, called Travel-Statistics. This part also includes a seperate read.me file, and a seperate data directory.
