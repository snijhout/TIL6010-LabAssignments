# CO2-emissions folder
The main file is Travel-statistics.ipynb, and from here are code can be run/output can be generated

for each block of code there is shortly explained what it does.

The first block of code takes long (10 min) as the data needs to be retrieved from the server

Libraries that need to be installed by file path - requirements.txt, so that geopy and pandas etc are included

(maybe change the name of the file CO2 effect later, because it is not only about that anymore)
